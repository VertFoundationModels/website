n**VerticalLM Summit 2025**  
 *A Colloquium on Domain-Specific Foundation Models*
 
 *Date TBD:  likely October 2025 at Stanford or elsewhere in the Bay Area*

**Introduction & Rationale**  
 As foundation models continue to reshape the AI landscape, a new wave of **vertical**, domain-tailored variants has emerged. Examples include:

* **Stripe’s FinancialLM**, which delivers state-of-the-art fraud detection and risk scoring across diverse merchant behaviors with only a few dozen labeled examples;

* **Netflix’s Merlin**, a recommender-focused Transformer that generalizes from movie and series metadata to novel content domains with minimal fine-tuning;

* **DeepTempo’s Tempo LogLM**, whose cybersecurity-specialized encoder identifies anomalous network flows by learning “normal” at massive scale, then spotting deviations in new environments with only light adaptation;

* **Kumo’s GNN based solution,** which is reporting outstanding results in making predictions from structured corporate data.

These vertical foundation models consistently demonstrate superior **generalization**—transferring learned representations across use cases—and achieve **state-of-the-art** results with **minimal adaptation**, reducing both data-labeling overhead and deployment time. Yet there is no dedicated forum for sharing best practices in building, evaluating, and governing these highly specialized systems. The **VerticalLM Summit** will bring together leading practitioners and researchers to address the unique challenges and opportunities of vertical foundation models across industries.

**Call for Participation**  
 We invite motivated experts to join:

1. **The Organizing Committee**

2. **The Paper Review Committee**

**Organizing Committee**  
 Members will:

* Coordinate all event logistics (venue, schedule, catering)

* Recruit and manage industry sponsors

* Oversee communications, marketing, and registration

* Liaise with Stanford’s hosting departments and facilities

**Paper Review Committee**  
 Members will:

* Define the colloquium’s topical scope (e.g., domain-specific pretraining strategies, evaluation frameworks, privacy/federation techniques, interpretability in context)

* Draft and publicize the Call for Papers (CFP)

* Conduct blind peer reviews, compile feedback, and recommend accepted submissions

* Curate panel discussions and poster sessions based on accepted papers

**Get Involved**  
If you’re passionate about advancing domain-tailored AI and shaping the future of vertical foundation models, we welcome you to serve on one or both committees. Please send a brief statement of interest and relevant experience to **evan@deeptempo.ai** by **July 15, 2025**.

**Conclusion**  
By establishing a dedicated gathering for vertical foundation models, the Vertical Foundation Model Summit 2025 aims to catalyze cross-sector collaboration, accelerate innovation, and promote responsible deployment of highly specialized AI systems that drive real-world impact. We look forward to your contributions in making this event a landmark for the next generation of domain-centric AI.
