# Call for papers and organizers for Vertical Foundation Model Colloquium
Please improve this web site by adding additional projects, improving the description of vertical foundation model projects, and however else you would suggest.

We are bootstrapping governance, using Github for transparency.  Eventually there will be volunteers and a committee of organizers that addresses marketing and hence the web site.
